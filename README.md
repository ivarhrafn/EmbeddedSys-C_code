Frequency-Controlled Load

Embedded System - Microcontroller NXP LPC2478

The purpose of the Frequency-Controlled Load software is to monitor the frequency of the power system
and adjust the load in correlation with the frequency fluctuation.

The microcontroller is connected to an analog board that steps down the input voltage and two relays, one connected
to a light bulb and the other to a power socket. The microcontroller then sets the relays on or off in
accordance with the frequency. 

The microcontroller comes equipped with an LCD display with touch screen functionality, which is used to set up a user interface.
